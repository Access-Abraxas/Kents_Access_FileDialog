Initial Commit of Kent Gorrell's File Dialog Project.  These files 
include: 

1. The "accdb" dir:

   a. Kents_FileDialog_Tools.accdb -
      The original Access ACCDB Database used to create the template.

   b. Kents_FileDialog_Tools.accdt - 
      The initial Access ACCDT Template file created from the .accdb file, 
      which has been decomposed into it's sourse files for Git tracking.

      
2. The "images" dir: 

   a. icon.jpg - 
      The icon file create for the template and this project.

   b. icon_sm.jpg - 
      The small version of the icon file create for the template and this 
      project.

   c. Screenshot.jpg - 
      The screenshot image used to create the accdt file for this project.


3. The "scripts" dir: 

   a. AssembleAccTemplate.bat - 
      A batch file to build an Access ACCDT template file from the files
      currently in the "src" folder in this project, and build it into the 
      "bin" directory for this project.

   b. UnzipAccTemplate.bat - 
      A batch file to expand the Access ACCDT template file, from the accdt
      file in the "accdb" directory, into the "src" directory. This will 
      delete any existing files in the "src" directory.


4. The "src" dir:

   The "src" directory contains all of the expanded files and directories 
   from the Access ACCDT template file, found in the "accdb" directory for 
   this project.  These file were created by running the 
   "UnzipAccTemplate.bat" script.  These files are all of the files needed
   to create an Access database from an Access template, which are in a text
   based format, so that we can track changes made to the original source 
   Access database found in the "accdb" folder of this project.


5. Files in the project root:

   a. ChangeLog.txt - 
      This file, which will theoretically track a list of changes made to 
      this Access database project.

   b. README.md -    
      This initial README file created by GitHub for this project.
