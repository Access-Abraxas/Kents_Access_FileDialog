Updated several tools within this project. I made some changes to the 
development database, as well as added a new Access database tool to 
prepare the dev project for uploading changes. Specifically, for this
set of changes, I made the following updates:

1. accdb\Kents_FileDialog_Tools.accdb - 
   Added an "Example" form in the development database, so that users 
   can test different FileDialog configurations.  The form also 
   provides example VBA code to use the FileDialog. 

2. accdb\DevHelper.accdb - 
   This is a new tool I've created to prep this code project for
   uploading changes into a Git repository.  This tool replaces the
   UnzipAccTemplate.bat tool.  There is a form in this database with 
   a button that will perform the following steps:
       a. Create the ACCDT from Kents_FileDialog_Tools.accdb
       b. Expand the template files into the 'src' directory

3. scripts\UnzipAccTemplate.bat - 
   Removed this file from the project, because this functionality has
   been replaced by the DevHelper.accdb database.

4. README.md - 
   Updated the readme file to reflect these changes.

Initial Commit of Kent Gorrell's File Dialog Project.  These files 
include: 

1. The "accdb" dir:

   a. Kents_FileDialog_Tools.accdb -
      The original Access ACCDB database used to create the template.

   b. Kents_FileDialog_Tools.accdt - 
      The initial Access ACCDT template file created from the .accdb file, 
      which has been decomposed into it's source files for Git tracking.

      
2. The "images" dir: 

   a. icon.jpg - 
      The icon file created for the template and this project.

   b. icon_sm.jpg - 
      A small version of the icon file created for the template and this 
      project.

   c. Screenshot.jpg - 
      The screenshot image used to create the ACCDT file for this project.


3. The "scripts" dir: 

   a. AssembleAccTemplate.bat - 
      A batch file to build an Access ACCDT template file from the files
      currently in the "src" folder in this project, and build it into the 
      "bin" directory for this project.

   b. UnzipAccTemplate.bat - 
      A batch file to expand the Access ACCDT template file, from the accdt
      file in the "accdb" directory, into the "src" directory. This will 
      delete any existing files in the "src" directory.


4. The "src" dir:

   The "src" directory contains all of the expanded files and directories 
   from the Access ACCDT template file, found in the "accdb" directory for 
   this project.  These file were created by running the 
   "UnzipAccTemplate.bat" script.  These files are all of the files needed
   to create an Access database from an Access template, which are in a text
   based format, so that we can track changes made to the original source 
   Access database found in the "accdb" folder of this project.


5. Files in the project root:

   a. ChangeLog.txt - 
      This file, which will theoretically track a list of changes made to 
      this Access database project.

   b. README.md -    
      The initial README file created by GitHub for this project.
